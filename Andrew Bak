# Uniqlo: The Brand
### Fashion should not be inaccessible.  Uniqlo as a brand caters to the customer by providing clothing that is **innovative**, **high quality**, and **affordable**
The concept that makes this brand stand out from others is their minimalistic approach.  Just by looking at their website with its simple red, white, and black theme, **simplicity** is _king_.
## Simplistic Design
 * Within each category, Uniqlo focuses on creating products that are simple for everyday use.
 * Their clothing distinguishes itself from competitors by being altered in the way they are cut and sewn rather than relying on loud themes like graphics.
## Innovative Technology
 * Every year, you can see Uniqlo creating new technology to be incorporated into their clothing
  * [Airism](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/page/airism.html) This technology was created to keep the user cool and comfortable while wicking away moisture and taking in sweat. Perfect for customers who lead active lifestyles but do not want to compromise on appearance over comfort.
  * [Heattech](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) This technology keeps customers warm by utilizing their own body heat which is perfect for colder months.
Even with all these different clothing technologies that improve the livelihood of their customers, they also value the look of their products.
## Affordable Pricing
 * Being a customer focused brand does not stop at looks and comfort. Uniqlo again, is able to separate themselves from the crowd by also keeping customer budgets in mind.  If you were too look at similar products from competing brands, the price would many times be double or triple the price.
 * Uniqlo is able to relate to their customers and price their products at prices that are attainable and fair.
 * Even with these low prices, Uniqlo: 
  * has sale after sale of items from the previous season so that no matter what your budget is, you can find something.
  * gives back to customers by sending coupons and rewards for continuing to support their brand.
Uniqlo as a brand pushes the idea that you as a consumer do not need to overspend to get high quality, fashionable clothing.  By shopping at Uniqlo, you support a company that puts you first. A company that is working to improve your life now and in the future.
